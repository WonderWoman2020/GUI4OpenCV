# GUI4OpenCV
This is an app for educational purpouses so students can focus on learning image processing algorithms from OpenCV and not on creating GUI. It will contain a few examplary functions from OpenCV, but overall it will be a template for students to put some more material into it. All people interested in learning OpenCV are welcome to try it out!
